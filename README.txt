This is my final project program for the semester.  My main goal with this program is to work on dictionaries, being able to access its keys
and iterate through the dictionary and its values.  My program is a simple phonebook program where the user can add
contacts to the phonebook by entering in a name and a number associated with the name.  The user can also view their entire contact list,
as well as search for a phone number according to a name in the phonebook.  The user can also choose to delete a contact through entering
in their name and deleting the number associated with their name.  They can also choose to save the phonebook which will dump all data 
collection in the dictionary, into a json file which will be later loaded upon next time activating the program.  
The user can also choose to quit the phonebook if they need to.
Basically, the phonebook acts as a sort of dictionary where the name and phone number are keys within it, and I'm showing ways to play with 
these two keys.  This project is also dabbling into the use of github and git repos, as well as json files.   

In order to use this program, it can be run through VSCode and results will be shown in the terminal.  You can also run this program
in your computer's terminal.  Upon activation of the program, you will be prompted with 6 choices to make, to add a contact,
to view all contacts, to search for a contact, to delete a contact, to save the phonebook, and to exit the program.
